      Steam Shortcut Manager is a command-line tool that allows users to easily add, remove,
      and check for non-Steam game shortcuts in their Steam library. It also features
      automatic generation and assignment of various Steam grid artwork types, including
      hero banners, grid images, portraits, icons, and logos.

    <p>
      This tool is particularly useful for integrating games from other launchers or emulated
      games into the Steam interface with proper visuals. It can also apply custom branding
      to the generated artwork.
